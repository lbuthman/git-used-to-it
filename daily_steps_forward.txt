3. discovered a potential method of practice, modeled after my background in classical guitar. It only makes
sense to me to practice the same solution several times to really deepen and memorize the process of coding,
syntax, or solution concept. This is a key artifact and potential source of value that I can develop, author
and offer.
4. started Ch. 32 in old Java book
-- most of the day was downtime due to computer battery recalibration

Day 06 - 03/10/17
1. completed section 2, Ch. 4 Pre-Calc book
2. completed Ch. 31 in Java book
3. worked out algorithm for calculating calories by meal
4. finished typing in artifacts developed yesterday
5. followed example in book to build distributed tic tac toe game -- the code they have is not perfect but is
an interesting jumping off point and definitely a lot to take in. One problem is that for testing, it only allows
one localhost, so it is impossible to play by myself. The second problem is that it does not close gracefully; I
think I can improve that with one line of code that closes the javafx correctly. A good improvement of the game
would be to allow competition vs. a computer, that way I can test it out completely.
