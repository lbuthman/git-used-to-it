Day 08 - 03/12/17
1. finished a couple sections, Think In Java
2. finished chapter and quiz, ch. 4 Pre-Calc
3. studied and took Java course mid-term
4. made good progress on PP3, put in about 3 hours and got most of it working

Day 07 - 03/11/17
1. test prep for Java course
2. found Thinking in Java and read the introduction, first chapter and started the GUI chapter
3. discovered a potential method of practice, modeled after my background in classical guitar. It only makes
sense to me to practice the same solution several times to really deepen and memorize the process of coding,
syntax, or solution concept. This is a key artifact and potential source of value that I can develop, author
and offer.
4. started Ch. 32 in old Java book
-- most of the day was downtime due to computer battery recalibration

Day 06 - 03/10/17
1. completed section 2, Ch. 4 Pre-Calc book
2. completed Ch. 31 in Java book
3. worked out algorithm for calculating calories by meal
4. finished typing in artifacts developed yesterday
5. followed example in book to build distributed tic tac toe game -- the code they have is not perfect but is
an interesting jumping off point and definitely a lot to take in. One problem is that for testing, it only allows
one localhost, so it is impossible to play by myself. The second problem is that it does not close gracefully; I
think I can improve that with one line of code that closes the javafx correctly. A good improvement of the game
would be to allow competition vs. a computer, that way I can test it out completely.

Day 05 - 03/09/17

1. completed one section, Ch. 4 Pre-Calc book
2. re-calibrated Java reading goals with improve direction
3. began writing my thoughts on education and writing, good start
4. fixed client login screen formatting and spacing to a good-enough-for-now standard, goal is to be barely
good at swing UI dev and I have reached that goal for now
5. added notes on user stories for app to text file
6. added future enhancement ideas to text file
7. stored idea for future app in text file

    Struts 2 Primer, CDI, Thymeleaf, Google App Engine, Groovy
3. made the first client/coach screen and first login screen, and they are the ugliest things with zero
    functionality, design, or care
4. created background notes on my foundation up to this point for voyeurs and people looking for help
