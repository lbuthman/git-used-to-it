Day 06 - 03/10/17
1. completed section 2, Ch. 4 Pre-Calc book
2. completed Ch. 31 in Java book
3. worked out algorithm for calculating calories by meal
4. finished typing in artifacts developed yesterday
5. followed example in book to build distributed tic tac toe game -- the code they have is not perfect but is
an interesting jumping off point and definitely a lot to take in. One problem is that for testing, it only allows
one localhost, so it is impossible to play by myself. The second problem is that it does not close gracefully; I
think I can improve that with one line of code that closes the javafx correctly. A good improvement of the game
would be to allow competition vs. a computer, that way I can test it out completely.
